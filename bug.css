The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 50px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is less than 50px, resulting in a negative width. Another common mistake is incorrect operator precedence, leading to unexpected results. Also, unit mismatch can lead to unexpected behavior, such as adding pixels to percentages directly. Using `calc(100% + 10px)` will fail, as you are adding a percentage value and a pixel value directly, so you need to use the same units, or use a separate calculation within calc().
